### 🧠 Personal Learning Highlights

Although built from a tutorial, this project really challenged me.

I struggled with:

* Connecting the MVC pattern — especially how data flows from model to view
* Bookmark feature: saving to localStorage and updating the UI
* Handling `hashchange` and `load` events
* Building pagination logic manually
* Implementing state updates without React or a framework

Each bug or confusing part pushed me to debug, slow down, and understand how everything connects.


> ⚠️ Built without a framework — just pure JS, bundled with Parcel.
